# INFOGENT: An Agent-Based Framework for Web Information Aggregation

INFOGENT is a modular framework designed for web information aggregation. Unlike traditional web agents focused on single-goal navigation, INFOGENTâ€™s unique architecture facilitates complex multi-source data gathering by leveraging autonomous components specialized in navigation, extraction, and aggregation.


## Overview

INFOGENT redefines web navigation for information-seeking tasks. It enables an agent to gather and aggregate information from various sources to answer complex queries. The framework supports both direct API-based access and interactive visual access modes, making it adaptable to a range of information retrieval scenarios. INFOGENT employs a modular, feedback-driven approach to information aggregation, making it suitable for complex queries requiring diverse sources.

- **Navigator**: Conducts web search and identifies relevant websites.
- **Extractor**: Extracts relevant information from the selected web pages.
- **Aggregator**: Aggregates the extracted data and provides feedback to the Navigator.
