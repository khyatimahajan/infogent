Lai was elected president with a plurality of 40.05% and was inaugurated on 20 May 2024.\nThe opposition Kuomintang (KMT) nominated the incumbent New Taipei mayor Hou Yu-ih as their candidate for president in May 2023. In November, Hou chose the former Legislative Yuan member Jaw Shaw-kong to be his running mate.\nThe Taiwan People's Party (TPP) nominated Ko Wen-je, its leader, the former Mayor of Taipei, who in turn chose Legislative Yuan member Cynthia Wu as his running mate. Despite previously saying he would support Hou's nomination, businessman Terry Gou declared his own independent bid in September 2023, before ultimately dropping out in November."

He was the Kuomintang's official candidate for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential elections. He first joined the party during the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek.\nPrior to the 2024 presidential election, Hou was considered the favorite for the Kuomintang presidential primary. He was drafted by the Kuomintang on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency. On 15 November 2023, KMT and Taiwan People's Party leadership announced that they would field a single joint presidential ticket made up of Hou and TPP chairman Ko Wen-je. The order was to be determined by opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November, but the parties were unable to reach an agreement on that date. Hou officially registered his candidacy with running mate Jaw Shaw-kong on 24 November 2023, ending the possibility of a joint ticket."

Voiced by: Koki Uchiyama (Japanese); Xander Mobus (English)\nPanda (\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0) is a second year student at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School who takes part in the Sister School Exchange Event. Although having an appearance of a giant panda, he is actually a unique type of Cursed Corpse created by Masamichi Yaga, the principal of the school, in which not only does Panda have sentience, but grows and matures as he ages. Also unique to him is having three 'cores' (the 'heart' of a Cursed Corpse), which he can change back and forth to unlock various abilities namely a Panda, Gorilla and a Triceratops. During the Sister School Event, he defeats and bonds with Mechamaru. After grieving the death of his creator, Masamichi Yaga, Panda joins the Culling Games with Itadori and Fushiguro in the effort to stop it. Panda engages in a battle with Hajime Kashimo, a resurrected sorcerer from the Heian era, who manages to defeat all of his cores. Only the interference of Kinji Hakari stops Kashimo from killing Panda. After his fight with Hajime Kashimo that resulted in the destruction of his body and his other two cores, Panda appears much smaller than his original size, resembling a panda cub.
